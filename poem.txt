The rainbow
Purple Pink Orange Blue Red Green Yellow
These are the colours of the rainbow

The rainbow
I love my rainbow

But then unicorns come in
They complement the rainbow 
Unicorns are such magical creatures
What would the world be without them

Ponies
Lets not forget about them
Ponies are the brothers and sisters of unicorns
:)
All they do is eat carrots and smile all day long
